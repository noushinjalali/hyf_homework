French Onion Soup


INGREDIENTS:

½ cup unsalted butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 cups sliced onions
5 cups beef broth
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 pinch salt and pepper to taste
4 slices French bread
4 slices provolone cheese
2 slices Swiss cheese, diced
¼ cup grated Parmesan chees
 
 
STEP 1:
Gather all ingredients.

STEP 2:
Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add onions to butter and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the onions.

STEP 3:
Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Let simmer for 30 minutes.

STEP 4:
Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.

STEP 5:
Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.

STEP 6:
Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.

STEP 7:
Serve hot and enjoy!
